    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

<table>
<ol>

<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Set out a baking sheet and line with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, add water and salt. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. </li>
<li>Add the P.A.N. White Corn Meal slowly and stir with a whisk or your hands.You’re looking for a dough that doesn’t easily stick to your hands, is moldable and moist, and can be rolled into a ball. </li>
<li>Roll into a ball and carefully press the ball between the palms of your hands to form into a roughly 1/2-inch thick disc (for thinner, crispier arepas, press closer to 1/4 inch);use your hands to close the cracks by gently patting along the edge.</li>
<li>Once the arepas are formed, heat a large cast-iron or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a little oil and swirl to coat. Then add arepas, giving them a little room in between so they don’t touch. Cook for 3-6 minutes or until deep golden brown (a few blackened spots are OK). You’re looking to form a crust. Then flip and cook for 3-6 minutes more or until the underside is also browned.</li>
<li>Transfer to your parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes or until slightly puffed up and a little more golden brown in color.</li>
<li>Cut the arepa 3/4 of the way around, leaving a seam on the edge so you can “stuff” it like a pita. Fillings could include anything you would like to. </li>
